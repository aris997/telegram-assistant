# Telegram to ChatGPT

This is a personal project for a telegram chatbot connected to ChatGPT by OpenAI API models.

Features to develope:

- [ ] Simple question response behavior
- [ ] Audio simple response behavior (maybe with whisper in local or whisper API for a better experience)
- [ ] Check the API live Chat with ChatGPT

- [ ] Memory behavior

## I would like

a simple way to edit the main command so the first part of the message should go to a intent classifier and to do that this will have to be as simple and light as possible. Just like a feature classifier. I just need to build:

- an embedding to create vectors
- a NN to analize the results
- a layer based on the numbers of intents I have.

I also need to know how many layers is good to go. And how to build a RNN or a transformer. I just have some studies to do.
